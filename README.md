## Overview

In this project, I created a full-stack application, which was a bit challenging but helped me to learn a lot. I used the provided JSON file to create a backend with routes using Node.js and Express. On the frontend side, I used React, Axios, and React Router to fetch and display data from the backend.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### What I learned

- Full-stack web development: I learned how to build a web application from scratch using back-end technologies like Node.js, Express, and the fs module, along with front-end technologies such as React, Axios, and React Router.

- RESTful API design: I learned how to design a RESTful API using Express and define routes and endpoints for the application.

- Data modeling and manipulation: I learned how to read and parse data from a JSON file using the fs module, and how to transform and manipulate data to prepare it for display in the application.

- Front-end design and layout: I learned how to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and React components.

- State management and data fetching: I learned how to manage state in the application using React hooks like useState and useEffect, and how to fetch data from the back-end API using Axios.
